# JLPT independent original authoring — 2026-10-06

This is the active checkpoint for the new authoring task. The historical recovery loop and JLPT_ACTIVE_PROGRESS.json do not authorize further transcription or recovery of original exams for this task.

## User decisions

- Create 20 original exams per level N5–N1 (100 total).
- First deliver one complete N5 pilot for publisher review.
- Publisher/user is the final reviewer; no completed human/native review may be inferred from that designation.
- Retain approved UI and agreed N5 timing: vocabulary 20 minutes, grammar/reading 40 minutes, listening approximately 30 minutes.
- Use the current N5 catalog 第3回 as the count-per-type reference. UI indexing and registry identify it as n5-2013-07-exam-03.
- Keep promotion rule: six different new exams at a level scoring at least 80%.
- Old JLPT attempt/progress records need not be preserved. Remove old exams/resources from the app when the replacement collection is complete. Do not reset unrelated learning/game data or rewrite Git history under this authorization.
- Audio/image tool and usage rights remain undecided. No old recording or illustration may fill a missing new asset.

## Structural extraction only

Read metadata from written.candidate.json and listening.candidate.json with a script that outputs grouping/counts only. No old prompts, options, answers, passages, scripts, recordings, or illustrations are authoring inputs.

| Section | Problem | Count | Skill |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| vocabulary | 1 | 12 | kanji reading |
| vocabulary | 2 | 8 | orthography |
| vocabulary | 3 | 10 | contextual vocabulary |
| vocabulary | 4 | 5 | paraphrase |
| grammar_reading | 1 | 16 | grammar selection |
| grammar_reading | 2 | 5 | sentence ordering |
| grammar_reading | 3 | 5 | text grammar |
| grammar_reading | 4 | 3 | short reading |
| grammar_reading | 5 | 2 | medium reading |
| grammar_reading | 6 | 1 | information retrieval |
| listening | 1 | 7 | task comprehension |
| listening | 2 | 6 | key-point comprehension |
| listening | 3 | 5 | situational utterance |
| listening | 4 | 6 | quick response |

Totals: 35 vocabulary + 32 grammar/reading + 24 listening = 91 responses. All 67 written reference items have four choices. Do not infer listening choice counts from written metadata. Reference-count approval is not proof of current official item counts.

## Authoring contract and next action

Author from learning objectives and independently conceived situations/data/solution logic. Reject superficial edits to old items (names, locations, amounts, word order, synonym substitutions). Create fresh correct options, plausible distractors, and internal QA rationales. Detailed rationales/transcripts remain hidden in the approved V1 UI.

Use independent IDs (proposed jpapp-n5-original-01-v1) and independent session keys. Drafts must be labelled AI-created/unreviewed. Actual publisher review and actual listening playback checks must be recorded before release claims.

Next: write the N5 pilot Japanese master against the count table above, with internal item objectives and distractor rationales. No new questions or audio have been authored as of this checkpoint. Audio generation, illustration generation, runtime integration, legacy removal, and progress migration have not been performed. Keep old content available only in the development state until the approved replacement gate; exclude it from the eventual production bundle/API/cache/fallback.

Do not initiate comparisons against old question content without separately confirming their purpose, scope, and separation with the user. Any ambiguity affecting counts, scoring, audio rights, or locked UI must be clarified rather than guessed.
